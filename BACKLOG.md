# Backlog

Ideas, feature requests, and wishlist items. Not prioritized, not committed to.

## Feature Requests

- **New facilitator welcome page** — First-time facilitators (no programs/rosters yet, or `has_seen_welcome` flag) see a welcome landing page with two paths: "Learn how it works" → Help page, "Get started" → Roster/program creation. Returning facilitators skip straight to their normal flow. (Requested by admin user feedback, 2026-02) **DONE**
- **Linked partners (keep-together)** — Allow marking two participants as "linked" so the solver keeps them at the same table (opposite of the current partner/couple behavior which separates them). Use case: a couple where one needs the other for health reasons (has come up multiple times in BBT programs). UX idea: inline toggle icon inside the partner cell (only visible when a partner is selected). Two icons — one showing two figures at the same table (keep together), one showing two figures at separate tables (separate, default). Click to toggle, auto-syncs both partners. Tooltip on hover explains the behavior. No new column needed. Solver would add a same-table constraint instead of different-table. Until implemented, users can leave them unmarked and manually place them together after generating. (Requested by stakeholder feedback, 2026-02) **DONE**
- **Google Drive file picker** — Allow direct file selection from Google Drive instead of download-then-upload. Uses Google Picker API (client-side only, no Drive access). Low priority — current upload flow works fine. (Requested by user, 2026-02)
- **TanStack Query for client-side caching** — Replace manual useEffect/useState fetch pattern with TanStack Query for stale-while-revalidate caching. Pages show cached data instantly on revisit, background refetch keeps data fresh. Mechanical refactor across ~5-6 page components. Biggest quick win for perceived performance. (2026-02) **DONE**

- **Local storage backend for localhost** — Dev mode currently hits live Firestore. Add a local storage option (Firebase emulator suite or in-memory mock) for localhost development to avoid unnecessary Firestore reads/writes and speed up local iteration. (2026-02) **DONE**

- **Roster table truncation with long names** — When partner names are long (e.g., "Christopher Montgomery-Wellington"), the Partner column truncates aggressively ("Christopher...") because the column is fixed at 200px and shares space with the link/unlink icon. The Name column also truncates. Tried: (1) `min-w-0` on SelectTrigger — helps prevent layout breakage but doesn't give more space; (2) flexible column widths (`min-w-[160px]` instead of `w-[200px]`) — causes column jitter when selecting partners, worse UX. Probably needs a different approach: wider partner column, responsive table, or tooltip on hover showing full name. Low priority — BBT roster has normal-length names. (2026-02)

## Chores

- **Custom SMTP for Firebase Auth emails** — Firebase's sign-in link email template is non-editable (body is hardcoded, shows project ID "group-builder-backend" as app name). Custom domain (`noreply@group-builder.com`) and SPF/DKIM are already configured. To customize the email content: configure SMTP settings in Firebase Console → Authentication → Templates → SMTP settings to send through Resend. Then replace Firebase's `sendSignInLinkToEmail()` in `frontend/src/services/firebase.ts` with a backend endpoint that generates the sign-in link via Admin SDK (`generate_sign_in_with_email_link` — already used in `api/src/api/services/email_service.py` for invites) and sends a custom-branded email through Resend. Purely aesthetic — sign-in emails currently work and land in inbox. (2026-02)
